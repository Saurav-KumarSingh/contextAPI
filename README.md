# ContextAPI

This project provides a way to share state and other data between components without having to pass props down manually at every level. It's a built-in React tool that allows for easier management and use of global state.

## Key Features

- **Global State Management**: ContextAPI enables you to create global level variables that can be accessed from any component.

- **Prop Drilling Elimination**: It eliminates the need for passing props from grandparent to child to grandchild, and so on.

- **Consumer and Provider Components**: The Provider component sets the context values, while the Consumer component accesses them.

## Usage

To use ContextAPI, you need to create a context, provide the data and finally consume it. Refer to the documentation for detailed usage.
